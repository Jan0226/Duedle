# Duedle
Duedle – an app designed specifically to help students turn big assignments into clear, daily action steps.

Managing due dates and keeping track of tasks can be extremely difficult and overwhelming – especially for students. The real challenge often comes down to time management. Many students struggle not because they lack motivation, but because they don’t know how to break down a big task into manageable steps within the time they have.
Traditional tools like calendars and to-do lists may help with reminders, but they don’t actually solve the problem. That’s why, for JamHacks 9, we created Duedle – an app designed specifically to help students turn big assignments into clear, daily action steps.
